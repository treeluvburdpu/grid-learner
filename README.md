# Grid Learner App

The Grid Learner app is designed to help young learners visually understand the basics of numbers and multiplication. It provides an interactive grid where users can explore numerical relationships in a fun and intuitive way, making abstract concepts more concrete.

## Features

The app offers three distinct interactive modes to facilitate learning:

### 1. Sum (Adder) Mode

This mode helps visualize addition. Users can select values for red, green, and blue columns (up to 10 each). The "Sum" column dynamically displays the combined total. An interactive feature allows users to "shift" the sum column components to understand regrouping in addition.

### 2. 10x20 Mode (Multiplication)

A traditional multiplication grid where users can select numbers on the top and left axes. The grid then highlights the corresponding area, visually representing the product of the selected numbers. Each cell represents an integer value.

### 3. 1.0x2.0 Mode (Decimal Multiplication)

Similar to the 10x20 mode, but designed for understanding decimal multiplication. When selected, the top and left axes, as well as the grid cells, display values in 0.1 and 0.01 increments, respectively, helping learners grasp fractional products visually.
